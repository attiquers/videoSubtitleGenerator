**Features to be added**
Dockerise this so it checks gpu and install on its own the models related to gpu


If you have got commerical free fonts, or you have made cool style using this send me a photo of it and i will add it in recommendations



This is an Ai Subtitles Generator that works automatiaclly, it extracts audio from video, transcribe the text and timeline for each word
Then after applying these styles those words are burnt onto the video frame by frame


Now there are a few models here and if you are using this on your PC I would suggest you to go for medium.en its the best one.

Before applying these on long video trim to 3 seconds and see if you like the look of your style or maybe you wanna tweak it a bit
